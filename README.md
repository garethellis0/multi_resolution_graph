# multi_res_graph
### A performant multi-resolution graph implementation
## Current Applications
- **UBC Thundebots**: Robotic soccer player pathfinding
- **UBC Snowbots**: Sparse mapping for large scale mapping and pathfinding of autonomous groud-based vehicles
- **simple_cfd**: One of my side projects, a 2d multi-resolution fluid simulator
